# Intro to AI \[Lab1\] Decision Tree

## Author: Louis Chang

## Introduction
A <b>Decision Tree</b> is a machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. It represents decisions and their possible outcomes in a tree-like structure. Each node in the tree corresponds to a feature of the data, and the branches represent decisions based on the feature's values, leading to leaf nodes that provide the final prediction.

In this Lab, we would want you to use <b>Decision Tree</b> to predict the satisfaction of an airplane passenger from different information.

The goal of this programming assignment is:
1) Learn how to prepare a dataset for machine learning
2) Implement Decision Tree
3) Get a taste of a complete supervised learning process
4) Learn what if overfit and how to prevent it
